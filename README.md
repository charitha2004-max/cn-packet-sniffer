PacketTrack – Network Packet Monitoring Dashboard

PacketTrack is a lightweight, web-based network packet simulation and monitoring dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It visually demonstrates how packets move in a network through live simulation, glowing animations, alerts, and real-time updates.

This project is ideal for Computer Networks mini-projects, academic submissions, and GitHub portfolio showcases.

🚀 Features
✔ Live Packet Simulation

Packets are generated dynamically every second with unique ID, IP addresses, type, and status.

✔ Neon Glow Animation

Every new packet glows briefly to resemble real network monitoring tools.

✔ Suspicious Packet Alerts

Packets marked as Suspicious are highlighted with glowing red/purple warning effects.

✔ Color-Coded Status

🟢 Received

🔵 Sent

🟡 In Transit

🔴 Error

🟣 Suspicious

✔ Search / Filter Bar

Filter packets by ID, source, destination, type, or status.

✔ Interactive Popup

Clicking a packet opens a modal showing complete details.

✔ Modern Cyber Dashboard UI

Dark theme + neon blue highlights for a clean and professional look.
